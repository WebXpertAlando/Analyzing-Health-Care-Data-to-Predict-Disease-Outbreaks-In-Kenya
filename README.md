# Analyzing-Health-Care-Data-to-Predict-Disease-Outbreaks-In-Kenya

# Introduction

# Problem Statement
Disease outbreak, such as malaria and chorela, can devastate communities in Kenya, especially in rural areas with limited healthcare resources. Early dectection and prediction of disease outbreaks can help allocate medical resources more effectively and save lives.

# Objectives
- To analyse healthcare data, including disease incidences, reports, hospital admissions, and climate data (such as temperature and rainfall, which often influence the spread of of diseases like malaria).

- Develop predictive  models for disease outbreaks based on healthcare and climate data.

- Develop an early warning systems for public health officials.

- Come up with Data Visualization dashboards to monitor disease trends.

# Expected Outcomes.

By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project will help healthcare providers and policymakers make proactive decisions, such as allowing vaccines, medical supplies and healthcare personnel to regions ast risks of an outbreak. 

# Project Implementation

The project will use python to build predictive models that identify trends in disease outbreaks and forcast future occurences.
